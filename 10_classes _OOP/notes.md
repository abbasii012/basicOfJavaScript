# JavaScript and Classes

## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities. Objects have properties (data) and methods (functions), allowing you to create complex programs that are easier to understand and maintain.

## Objects
- Objects are collections of properties and methods. In JavaScript, you can create objects using object literals, constructor functions, or classes.

## Why Use OOP?

OOP is used because it makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand. By modeling real-world entities as objects, developers can break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces. This approach also allows the use of inheritance and polymorphism to reduce redundancy in code.

## Parts of OOP in JavaScript

### Object Literal
An object literal is a simple way to create objects in JavaScript by directly defining properties and methods inside curly braces.

\`\`\`javascript
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2021,
  drive: function() {
    console.log("The car is driving");
  }
};

car.drive();  // Output: "The car is driving"
\`\`\`

### Constructor Function
Constructor functions are a more formal way of defining objects. They act as blueprints from which multiple instances of an object can be created.

\`\`\`javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

const myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022);
console.log(myCar.model);  // Output: "Civic"
\`\`\`

### Prototypes
JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype. This is a way of adding shared methods to multiple instances without redefining them every time.

\`\`\`javascript
Car.prototype.start = function() {
  console.log(this.make + " is starting");
};

myCar.start();  // Output: "Honda is starting"
\`\`\`

### Classes
ES6 introduced classes, which are a more concise way to define constructor functions and prototypes.

\`\`\`javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  start() {
    console.log(\`\${this.make} is starting\`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Tesla", "Model 3", 2023);
myCar.start();  // Output: "Tesla is starting"
\`\`\`

### Instances (new, this)
When you create an object from a class using the \`new\` keyword, you create an instance of that class. The \`this\` keyword refers to the current object (instance) being created or modified.

\`\`\`javascript
const anotherCar = new Car("Ford", "F-150", 2021);
console.log(anotherCar.year);  // Output: 2021
\`\`\`

## The Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. Abstraction
Abstraction allows you to hide complex logic behind simple interfaces. The user interacts with the object without needing to understand its inner workings.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
class Phone {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  call(number) {
    console.log(\`Calling \${number}...\`);
  }
}

const myPhone = new Phone("Apple", "iPhone 13");
myPhone.call("123-456-7890");  // The user doesn't need to know how the calling function works internally.
\`\`\`

### 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts access to certain properties and methods of an object to protect its integrity. In JavaScript, you can achieve this by using closures or by marking properties as private.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // private property

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(100);
console.log(account.getBalance());  // Output: 100
\`\`\`

### 3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and a cleaner architecture.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(\`\${this.name} makes a sound.\`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(\`\${this.name} barks.\`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
myDog.speak();  // Output: "Buddy barks."
\`\`\`

### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class. It enables one method to have different behaviors based on the object calling it.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
class Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a shape");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a circle");
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a square");
  }
}

const shapes = [new Circle(), new Square()];
shapes.forEach(shape => shape.draw());  // Output: "Drawing a circle" and "Drawing a square"
\`\`\`
